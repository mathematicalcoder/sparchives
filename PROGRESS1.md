# Project Progress 1
*_SPARChives_, a Computer Science 3 project by Kaiser Travis Chan (and Schiel Lueone Battung). Last updated on 24 January 2025.*

## Prospective web pages and other plans (for the rest of the academic year)
### Addition of more reviewers and mock tests
The website mainly focuses on the reviewers and mock tests that are written by people in SPARC. The plan is to upload as many reviewers and mock tests as possible to turn the website into a comprehensive pseudo-database (as it currently consists of JS objects). _However, the bulk of the committeeâ€™s reviewers are written by members outside the website project, so there is a huge chance that this website will remain merely as a prototype and might be used in its entirety once the school year ends._
### Exam calendar
The exam calendar will be a reference for the exams of the batch per week/month.
### Gradesheet
The gradesheet allows users to compute their grades in a certain subject given their scores. Ideally the data will be saved in the computer/browser's local storage until accounts are implemented.
### Account system and other databases (least priority)
The account system would let users save their progress in reviewers and mock tests and also their grades in the gradesheet so they can easily access their data from any device. Additionally, this would let SPARC committee members contribute their own reviewers and mock tests (either as a link or in markdown form) and get it up in the website. _This is the least priority among the prospective pages as it is the hardest to implement and it is likely outside the scope of the third quarter of CS 3._
## Updates on existing pages
### Reviewers
### Mock tests
### Essential hyperlinks
